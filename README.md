#Trip Based Modeling Of Fuel Consumption In Modern Fleet Vehicles Using Machine Learning

Ability to model and predict the fuel consumption is vital in enhancing fuel economy of vehicles and preventing fraudulent activities in fleet management. Fuel consumption of a vehicle depends on several internal & external factors However, not all these factors may be measured or available for the fuel consumption analysis. 

The main aim of the project is to build Machine Learning  algorithm to predict the fuel consumption of  fleet vehicles based on the gas type . A web application is built which is integrated with ML model

1.Project Objectives:
       -To understand the problem to classify if it is a regression or a classification kind of problem.
       -To know how to pre-process/clean the data using different data pre-processing techniques.
       -Applying different algorithms according to the dataset 
       -To know how to find the accuracy of the model.
       -To build web applications using the Flask framework.
2.Project Flow:
      -Download the dataset.
      -Preprocess or clean the data.
      -Analyze the pre-processed data.
      -Train the machine with preprocessed data using an appropriate machine learning algorithm.
      -Save the model and its dependencies.
      -Build a Web application using flask that integrates with the model built.
